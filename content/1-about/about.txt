We are specialised in handmade and hand-drawn tapestry, custom-crafted for museums, public institutions, domestic spaces and corporates.

Our work is often a collaborative effort between the clients need and our creative input. Each of our tapestry or carpets is unique, tailor-made and exclusive to the project. Our tapestry are used in a variety of spaces in which they benefit the atmosphere, acoustics and safety.

Our tapestry is in all its stages developed and crafted in European Union. We strive to use the finest local materials and dyes exclusively organic in origin. We collaborate with our production partner, Regeneracija.
